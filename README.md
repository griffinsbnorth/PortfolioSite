# Griffin's Portfolio Site V3 (using React)
Hey, I'm Griffin, and this repo is to showcase the work I did remaking my portfolio using React as a way to learn it. The site doubles as both a Software Developer portfolio and Digital Illustrator portfolio, utilizing multiple React libraries including React Bootstrap, and Lightbox galleries. Feel free to peruse the code here to see what I did.
## Not Included:
I use a flat file JSON database for my software projects, and art pieces. The files and assets associated with them are not included here.
I also use a PHP backend for the Contact Form which isn't included here.
